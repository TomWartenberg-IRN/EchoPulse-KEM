## Overview

**EchoPulse** is an adaptive symbolic Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM) framework tailored for cybersecurity, embedded defense systems, and post-quantum cryptography. It introduces symbolic state chaining, mutation-resistance paths, and entropy-controlled encapsulation, and was developed as an alternative research structure in response to emerging threats and niche KEM bottlenecks in constrained systems.

The project combines Rust-based cryptographic implementations with graph-based logic mapping and symbolic transformation layers. EchoPulse offers a modular foundation for secure key exchange, critical system isolation, and advanced protocol modeling.

## Key Features

- Post-quantum secure symbolic KEM path modeling  
- Graph-based state transition and key mutation resistance  
- Rust implementation with test vectors and benchmarking  
- Strategic path derivation (side-channel hardened concepts)  
- SHA-3 bottleneck analysis and alternate hashing support  
- Protocol adaptation framework for real-world systems
